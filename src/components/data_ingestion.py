    Data ingestion is the process of collecting and importing data from various sources into a machine-learning model. 
    It is the first step in building a machine-learning model and is crucial for the success of the model.
    Without proper data ingestion, the model will not be able to learn and make accurate predictions.

    The data_ingestion file could include code for:
    *   Connecting to data sources like databases or APIs.
    *   Reading data from files or streaming platforms.
    *   Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
    *   Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
