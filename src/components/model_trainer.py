    *   model_trainer file typically contains the code that is responsible for training the machine learning model.
    *   model_trainer file might handle:
        -   Model Selection: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm for the problem at hand1.
        -   Model Training: Feeding the training data to the model and adjusting the model’s parameters based on the training data1.
        -   Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model on a separate validation dataset1.
        -   Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model’s hyperparameters to improve its performance1.
        -   Model Saving: Saving the trained model for later use in prediction1.
